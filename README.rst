``c2cpyramid``
==============

``c2cpyramid`` is a package which provides "c2c" scaffolding for creating a
Pyramid application with a "Camptocamp flavour".

This scaffold is intended to be used on applications that have already been
generated using the "alchemy" scaffold included in Pyramid.

So here's how to bootstrap a new project::

    $ pcreate -s alchemy -s c2c MyProject
