``c2cpyramid``
==============

``c2cpyramid`` is a package which provides "c2c" scaffolding for creating a
Pyramid application with a "Camptocamp flavour".

This scaffold is intended to be used on applications that have already been
generated using the "alchemy" scaffold which is directly included in Pyramid.

So here's how to bootstrap a new project in one line::

    $ pcreate -s alchemy -s c2c MyProject
